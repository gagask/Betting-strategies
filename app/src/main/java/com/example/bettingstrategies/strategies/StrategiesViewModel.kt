Both involve increased stakes after a win, and both involve a cycle of bets ending at a fixed point. The only real difference is the actual betting sequence. Of course, as in any betting system, there are also disadvantages. We explore the positive and negative aspects of the 1-3-2-6 below, along with the details and how it is used. Like many betting systems, the 1-3-2-6 was designed for bets that pay out an even sum, like the red-black bets in roulette. In fact, it is widely used on the roulette table and in other casino games such as baccarat, dice games and blackjack. Basically, it doesn’t matter what you use it for, provided you are playing with even sums. For example, if you wanted to play with a total of 500 €, 10 € would be a reasonable number. A bet unit is the amount you wager on the first bet in the sequence. After every lost bet, the sequence ends and you start a new one – and again you insert a betting unit.\n" +

                    "If you win a bet, you adjust your stake according to the sequence 1-3-2-6. So, if you win your first bet, the next time you increase your stake to € 30 (three betting units). If you win this too, you will place € 20 on your next bet. If you win this too, the next time you wager € 60. And already we have the 1-3-2-6 sequence.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "If you win the fourth, consecutive bet then the sequence is completed and you start all over again. Don’t forget, as soon as you lose, your stake will also reset to a betting unit.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "This is basically what the 1-3-2-6 betting system is all about. As long as you keep the simple set of rules in mind, you shouldn’t have any problems using this system successfully."),

                    "Of course, this is no guarantee that you will always bet correctly and the assessment of how likely the outcome of a game is, does still remain up to you. But the Kelly formula can help you choose the size of your bet. This is how the Kelly formula works\n" +

                    "Then, you put the probability and the odds in the Kelly formula and get a value from it \n\n Now, of course, the use of this formula also depends heavily on your assessment of the probability. And if you consider a game outcome to be very likely and thus increase the value considerably, then it can happen that you get 30% or even more of your bankroll as a result. Of course, caution is advised here because your bankroll can slide down very quickly this way."),

"All-in on odds at 1.20 strategy", "This betting strategy involves winning numerous bets one after the other and always using the maximum offers the opportunity to earn decent money. But it is also clear that all the money is gone if you lose a bet. But if you manage to win 30, 35, maybe even 40 times in a row, you’ll get big money! We use odds around 1.20 for this – ideally you should look for the bets you are playing live. As with the strategy of betting over 1.5 goals in what is estimated to be typical “over” games, you can wait here until the odds have reached the desired level. The over 0.5 bet is ideal here – i.e. the bet that the game will not end 0-0. Usually, after goalless 30 minutes, you get a rate of 1.20 – depending on the match, this can of course be lower, but sometimes even higher. Of course, it is a matter of taste with which type of bet you want to monetize your betting sequence, or money race‘ as it is also called.\n" +

                    "It is important that you always play roughly the same odds. This is certainly a test of patience and not particularly spectacular at first, but there is no exact goal and you can stop at any time and have your winnings paid out. For example, if you start such a series of bets with a stake of 10 €, that’s all you can lose. So you now find a bet with odds 1.20, win it and immediately play the 12 € you won again on odds that are around this amount. You win 14.40 € – which will be invested in the next bet.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The profits will only become noticeable very slowly, but will increase sharply over time, because of course the stake grows higher and higher. If you actually manage to get 30 picks right in a row, your 10 € from the beginning will already be a whopping 2,373.76 €. After 35 correct pick we would already be at 5,906.68 € and after 40 correct picks at 14,697.71 €."),

If you lose, just bet on the next tie according to a certain key and start increasing your stake. It is important that the odds for the tie are above 2.62 (more precisely: 2.618); luckily for those who want to employ this strategy, there are many tie bets for this minimum odds.

            Strategy("https://alvin-almazov.com/wp-content/uploads/unnamed-1.png", "1X on home outsiders strategy", "A betting strategy that has been successful in the past is the bet on the “double chance” 1X if an outsider plays against a favorite at home. In this case, the “1X” bet brings respectable odds and very interesting profit opportunities. You don’t even have to choose and analyze games that contain absolute extremes and obvious class differences with this strategy. So, you don’t necessarily have to bet against Barcelona, Bayern or Juventus as an away team. Here, we would probably move away from the value bets. Even if we opt for teams that are not big outsiders, but are still outsiders according to the odds, we find highly interesting odds between 1.60 and 2.50.\n" +

You should of course take statistics into account, advance information about injuries and suspensions, as well as the current shape of the teams. The home advantage of the outsider, for whom games in front of their own audience against a “bigger one” also represent a special motivation, should not be underestimated as it brings another small advantage for the home team. Especially when the respective favorite has recently shown itself shaky against “smaller ones”, you can definitely find value in such an outsider bet with double chances."),

This should not be confused with arbitrage, which involves betting on all possible outcomes of an event, so that a guaranteed profit is generated. This is only possible by using several bookmakers and only for a few events. \n\n Dutching is ideal for multi-outcome events where you think you can break the possible outcomes down to two or three; but in theory, you can bet on any number of selections. The fewer selections you make in dutching, the fewer losers you support and the more profit you make from them. However, by dutching fewer selections, you increase your risk. \n\nThe main characteristic of Dutching is that you win the same amount, but with all the different odds involved, it can sometimes be difficult to figure out the stakes required."),
